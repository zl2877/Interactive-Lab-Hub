## Overview
For this assignment, you are going to 

A) [Connect to your Pi](#part-a)  

B) [Try out cli_clock.py](#part-b) 

C) [Set up your RGB display](#part-c)

D) [Try out clock_display_demo](#part-d) 

E) [Modify the code to make the display your own](#part-e)

F) [Make a short video of your modified barebones PiClock](#part-f)

G) [Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock for Part 2.](#part-g)

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the \*\*\***stars**\*\*\*. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

# Prep for Part 2

1. Pick up remaining parts for kit on Thursday lab class. Check the updated [parts list inventory](partslist.md) and let the TA know if there is any part missing.
  
2. Look at and give feedback on the Part G. for at least 2 other people in the class (and get 2 people to comment on your Part G!)

# Lab 2 Part 2

Feedback to our lab2 part 1: 

- I think the idea was cool. But the clock was confusing to read. I didn't really get the change between the two buttons the first time I interacted with the device.

- The displays could be improved, perhaps adding more colors or different font size. It was interesting seeing time being calculated this way.
    

By pressing button 1, the user can see the fruits in season for the specific season he/she is in right now. There is also a time at the top, showing the time until the next season.

By pressing button 2, the user can see the fruits in season for the next season.
